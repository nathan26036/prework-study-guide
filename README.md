# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was walked through the basics to coding a website. The website is also used to help me remember some notes on some topics such as HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. I was able to learn to code and even make a study guide all in one.

## Usage

The main usage for this is to be studied. There are four different sections and each with different topics to be learned such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
